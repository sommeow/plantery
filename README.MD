## **About**

I am a huge believer that plants make people happy. There is no shortage of scientific journals and clickbait articles that boasts about all the things a lone fern can do for a person and their environment, but for me, I know that nature nurtures my mind. My intention with this app is to make having a real, living plant in homes more accessible for everyone. There can be lots of moving parts to taking care of a plant, and I don't want that to stop someone from inviting a little green therapy into their space.
